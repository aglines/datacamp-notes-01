SETUP
SETUP - notes, noise, focus

====  turn off intellisense. settings.json lets you do this for lg-specific filetypes
added to C:\Users\[me]\AppData\Roaming\Code\User
    
"[plaintext]": {
  "editor.quickSuggestions": {
    "other": false,
    "comments": false,
    "strings": false
  }
}

==== NOISE CONTROL for openplan workspaces
- airpods w noizio app playing whitenoise
- over-ear headphones w mike
- dictation set up so notes are easier,
- men kommer ih'g att dictation follows kb settings, so to dicatet in Eng..
    men... j måste inte, för att nu kan j sv hela tiden förmodlg även m anteckngr *shrug emoji*

- later challenge - could I brew my own noise types? easier to dictate code if punctuation is right
  there probably exists tools to do this at this point


==== github repo i know this is stupid but this is the most efficient note-taking way for me jn

nu kan vi kör
