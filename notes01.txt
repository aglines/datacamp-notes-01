int
float

string
    in 'single quotes' or "double" but CANNOT mix these, no surpr there
    variable methods like concat  but can use math terms like + 
        doubledesc = desc + desc
bool
  Capitalize as True or False, 1 or 0

  trying to mess around w .toString method but no work, 
    if (profitable == True) : {print(type(profitable.toString)) }
    bool object has no attribute 'toString'
      ohhh yeah it's just str(x_boolean_value)
print(type(year1))  # however this works

=========== CONVERT TYPES
str(x)
int(x)
